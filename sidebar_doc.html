    <h3>Instructions for Using This Sheet</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Do not make changes to highlighted columns.</strong> Changes made to highlighted columns will not populate the master spreadsheet and will be lost.</li>
    <li>Changes made to unhighlighted columns will ONLY populate the data hub and be visible to others <strong>when you update your work.</strong> </li>
    <li>To update your work, click on <strong>Serials Data</strong> and then <strong>Update Data Hub.</strong> The first time you do this, the app will ask for permissions that will only affect this spreadsheet; use your gwu e-mail address and grant the permissions.</li>
    <li>If you leave the sheet open for a long time, you will need to refresh the page in order to see any changes that may have been  made since you opened it.</li>
    <li>To refresh the page, click on <strong>Serials Data</strong> then <strong>Get Latest Data</strong></li>
    <li>While you are free to add columns to the spreadsheet, <strong>do not</strong> delete columns. Also, keep in mind that anyone in the same role (finance, negotiations, etc.) accessing the spreadsheet will be able to see the columns you add.
    <li> Use <strong>Data --> Filter views...</strong> to hide unwanted rows.</li>
    <li>Sorting the data is permitted as it does not affect the data hub or the ability of the sheet to receive new updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not delete</strong> rows. If you think rows are present in error, please contact the data hub administrators, Dolsy Smith (dsmith@gwu.edu) or Joyce Whitmore (whitmore@gwu.edu).
